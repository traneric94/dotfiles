"QUESTION BANK: Centralized logging for hundreds of accounts.
Which option best satisfies the requirement that all accounts deliver immutable audit logs to a security account while preventing workloads from disabling logging?
A. Enable CloudTrail in each account with an S3 bucket in that account. Use AWS Backup to copy logs to the security account.
B. Create an organization trail storing logs in the security account S3 bucket with Object Lock, use KMS CMK from security account, and attach an SCP denying cloudtrail:StopLogging.
C. Configure CloudTrail to CloudWatch Logs in each account and subscribe to a central Kinesis stream in the security account.
D. Stream CloudTrail to EventBridge and write to DynamoDB global tables for retention.","Correct: B. Organization trails ensure every member account delivers to the centralized S3 bucket; Object Lock prevents tampering and SCPs keep logging enabled.
Why not A: S3 buckets per account increase management complexity and workloads could still disable trails locally.
Why not C: CloudWatch log subscriptions per account scale poorly and do not provide immutable storage by default.
Why not D: EventBridge targets and DynamoDB are not designed for long-term, immutable log retention.","question-bank;governance;logging"
"QUESTION BANK: Multi-account networking and inspection.
You must centralize ingress/egress inspection for 200 VPCs across multiple OUs while minimizing operational overhead.
A. Create full-mesh VPC peering and deploy firewall appliances in each VPC.
B. Deploy a centralized AWS Network Firewall in a dedicated egress VPC connected via Transit Gateway, share route tables, and manage policies with Firewall Manager.
C. Use VPC Lattice to route all traffic through a centralized service running iptables.
D. Configure NAT instances in each VPC with custom iptables rules.","Correct: B. TGW + Network Firewall centralizes inspection with managed rules and Firewall Manager policy distribution.
Why not A: Full-mesh peering does not scale and distributed firewalls are operationally heavy.
Why not C: VPC Lattice targets service-to-service, not blanket ingress/egress inspection.
Why not D: NAT instances per VPC increase management overhead and are not highly available by default.","question-bank;networking;security"
"QUESTION BANK: High availability database design.
A payments platform requires <1 min RPO and <1 min RTO across two Regions.
A. RDS Multi-AZ with automated backups and cross-Region read replica.
B. Aurora Global Database with managed replication and planned failover runbook.
C. DynamoDB on-demand tables with global secondary indexes.
D. Self-managed MySQL on EC2 with asynchronous replication.","Correct: B. Aurora Global Database meets sub-minute RPO/RTO, purpose-built for cross-Region resiliency.
Why not A: Cross-Region read replicas are asynchronous, risking >1 minute data loss and longer failover.
Why not C: DynamoDB could work but would require application rewrite; question implies relational workload.
Why not D: Self-managed MySQL cannot guarantee the SLA without significant custom engineering.","question-bank;database;resiliency"
"QUESTION BANK: Serverless API with strict latency.
You run a latency-sensitive API on Lambda, globally accessible, with unpredictable spikes. How do you ensure consistent performance?

B. Increase Lambda memory and rely on CloudFront caching.
C. Move to ECS Fargate to avoid cold starts entirely.
D. Place Lambda in a VPC with provisioned concurrency disabled to reuse ENIs.","Correct: A. Provisioned concurrency + Global Accelerator ensures warm capacity and low-latency routing.
Why not B: Memory tuning helps but does not eliminate cold starts or global latency on its own.
Why not C: Fargate may work but increases ops overhead; question focuses on improving Lambda.
Why not D: Disabling provisioned concurrency reintroduces cold starts; VPC attachments add startup latency.","question-bank;serverless;performance"
"QUESTION BANK: Data lake governance.
You must allow analytics teams in multiple accounts controlled access to curated S3 datasets without copying data.

B. Enable Lake Formation cross-account sharing using LF-Tags and grant principals access through the Data Catalog.
C. Distribute daily CSV exports to each account via S3 Batch Operations.
D. Use DataSync to copy datasets into each account nightly.","Correct: B. Lake Formation cross-account shares enforce fine-grained permissions without data duplication.
Why not A: Bucket ACLs are coarse and bypass governance best practices.
Why not C: CSV exports duplicate data and complicate governance.

A. One Direct Connect with VPN failover in the same colocation.
B. Two Direct Connect connections in separate facilities using LAG plus redundant VPNs into Transit Gateway.
C. IPSec VPN only with BGP.
D. GRE tunnels over the internet with static routing.","Correct: B. Dual DX in separate sites with VPN backup and TGW provides high availability.

C. Store all tenant data in S3 with signed URLs and no additional controls.
D. Use a single account for all tenants without tagging.","Correct: A. Multi-tenant DynamoDB with ABAC policies and namespace isolation balances scale and compliance.

B. Use EventBridge rules on GuardDuty findings to invoke SSM Automation documents that remove instance from ELB, detach IAM roles, and isolate SGs.
C. Configure AWS Config rules to delete instances immediately.
D. Send SNS notification to administrators for follow-up.","Correct: B. EventBridge + SSM Automation provides automated, auditable incident response.
Why not A: Manual remediation is slow and error-prone.
Why not C: Deleting instances may destroy evidence and disrupt services; better to isolate.
Why not D: Notifications alone do not satisfy automation requirement.","question-bank;security;operations"

B. Scale up the EC2 instance size and rely on snapshots before deployment.
C. Move the app back on-premises until refactor complete.
D. Use a single EC2 instance with manual rsync deployments.","Correct: A. Blue/green plus strangler pattern reduces downtime and enables incremental modernization.
Why not B: Scaling hardware doesnâ€™t address deployment risk or modernization.

C. Use Outposts racks in each metro and run a full landing zone locally.
D. Place EC2 instances in the nearest available AZ and hope latency is acceptable.","Correct: B. Local Zones provide low-latency compute with centralized management and GA improves routing.
Why not A: Central Region alone may exceed latency requirements despite caching.
Why not C: Outposts may be overkill and costly for each metro when Local Zones suffice.
Why not D: No guarantee of meeting sub-10ms latency.","question-bank;edge;networking"
"QUESTION BANK: Compliance evidence automation.
Need auditable evidence for PCI across all accounts with minimal manual effort.
A. Export CloudTrail logs quarterly and email spreadsheets.
B. Use AWS Audit Manager with the PCI framework, integrate Config and Security Hub data sources, and store evidence in S3 with Object Lock.
C. Maintain a wiki page that engineers update after changes.

"QUESTION BANK: Data exfiltration control.
Requirement: Prevent private subnet workloads from sending data to unauthorized internet endpoints while still accessing S3 and approved APIs.
A. Route all traffic through NAT Gateway and rely on IAM roles.
