ECS vs EKS selection?	ECS for AWS-native simplicity; EKS for Kubernetes ecosystem/portability; both support Fargate.	aws sap containers
Service mesh on AWS?	AWS App Mesh for traffic shaping, mTLS, retries/timeouts across ECS/EKS/EC2 services.	aws sap containers
Cluster autoscaling patterns?	EC2 ASG with Cluster AutoScaler (EKS); Karpenter for provisioning; Fargate for serverless pods/tasks.	aws sap containers
Ingress choices?	ALB Ingress Controller (EKS), NLB for gRPC/TCP, Gateway API (emerging); WAF at ALB/CloudFront.	aws sap containers
Registry and image security?	ECR with scanning/signing (Sigstore/Notation), least privilege; private links to ECR.	aws sap containers
Secrets/config for containers?	Secrets Manager/Parameter Store with IAM task roles; Kubernetes secrets with KMS (EKS Envelope Encryption).	aws sap containers
Multi-account/multi-VPC connectivity?	TGW hub-and-spoke, PrivateLink for service exposure, VPC Lattice for service connectivity with auth.	aws sap containers
Logging and tracing?	Sidecars/Daemons for logs/metrics; OpenTelemetry collectors; CloudWatch/Fluent Bit integration.	aws sap containers
Blue/green and canary?	ECS CodeDeploy blue/green; EKS service mesh or progressive delivery controllers for canary.	aws sap containers
Cost controls?	Right-size tasks/pods, Spot/Fargate Spot, bin packing, GP2â†’GP3; avoid cross-AZ data transfer.	aws sap containers
