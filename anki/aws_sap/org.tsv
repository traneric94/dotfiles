When use AWS Organizations vs single account?	Multi-account: isolation, blast radius, billing separation, SCP guardrails; single account only for trivial/sandbox.	aws sap org
How to structure OUs for least surprise?	Top-level: Security, Infrastructure/Shared Services, Sandbox, Workloads (Prod/Non-Prod). Add Compliance/Regulated OUs when needed.	aws sap org
What do SCPs restrict?	The maximum permissions in an account, regardless of identity policies. Attach to OUs/accounts; allow-list or deny-list models.	aws sap org
How to block use of unapproved Regions?	Use SCP with aws:RequestedRegion condition to allow only approved Regions.	aws sap org
How to ensure S3 public access cannot be disabled?	Use SCP to deny s3:PutAccountPublicAccessBlock = false; enforce account-level Block Public Access.	aws sap org
How to centralize security services?	Use delegated admin for GuardDuty, Security Hub, Macie, Inspector. Aggregate findings in a Security account.	aws sap org
Whatâ€™s the account vending pattern?	Control Tower Account Factory or custom account factory via Service Catalog; baseline with guardrails and IAM Identity Center access.	aws sap org
How to implement SSO across accounts?	IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) with permission sets and account assignments; optionally federate with external IdP.	aws sap org
How to share resources without peering?	Use AWS RAM for subnets, Route 53 resolver rules, licenses, KMS keys (via grants) across accounts.	aws sap org
How to enforce tagging across org?	Use Tag Policies, Config rules, and SCPs denying untagged resource creation.	aws sap org
How to enable org-wide auditing?	Create an org-level CloudTrail with log file validation, centralized S3/KMS, and CloudTrail Lake as needed.	aws sap org
How to standardize baseline config?	Use AWS Config aggregators and conformance packs; Control Tower guardrails provide managed sets of controls.	aws sap org
How to isolate workloads by environment?	Separate Prod/Non-Prod OUs and accounts; restrict Prod access; use CI/CD to promote artifacts.	aws sap org
How to centralize DNS?	Shared services VPC hosts Route 53 Resolver inbound/outbound endpoints; share rules via RAM; use private hosted zones.	aws sap org
How to handle break-glass access?	Create a tightly controlled emergency role excluded from certain SCP denies; monitor and alert on usage.	aws sap org
