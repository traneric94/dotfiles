Difference between SCP, IAM policy, and permission boundary?	SCP sets org-level max permissions; IAM policy grants to principals; permission boundary caps a principal's effective permissions.	aws sap security
How to design KMS key policies?	Minimal key policy delegating to IAM, restrict via conditions; use grants for cross-account and services; enable key rotation as needed.	aws sap security
When use multi-Region KMS keys?	When replicating encrypted data across Regions to keep encryption consistent and enable regional decrypt.	aws sap security
Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store?	Secrets Manager for rotation and auditing; Parameter Store for config/cheaper secrets; Advanced tier adds policies.	aws sap security
GuardDuty/Macie/Inspector aggregation?	Enable org integration with delegated admin; centralize findings in Security Hub; forward to SIEM.	aws sap security
S3 public access control?	Account/bucket-level Block Public Access; bucket policies deny public; monitor via Config rules.	aws sap security
Zero trust patterns in AWS?	Use IAM auth for services, PrivateLink/VPC Lattice, CloudFront signed URLs, and resource-based policies with conditions.	aws sap security
Certificate management?	ACM for public/private certs; ACM PCA for private hierarchy; automate renewals; enforce TLS policies.	aws sap security
Signing and verification?	Use SigV4 for AWS APIs; KMS for signing keys (asymmetric or HMAC); Code signing for Lambda/containers.	aws sap security
Cross-account access principle?	Prefer roles assumed from source account; limit trust policies; use external IDs for third-party access.	aws sap security
IAM Identity Center permissions?	Permission sets map to roles per account; use least privilege and ABAC with tags if applicable.	aws sap security
Data classification controls?	Macie for discovery; S3 Object Lock for WORM; KMS + bucket policies; DLP workflows.	aws sap security
WAF best practices?	Managed rule groups + custom rules, rate limiting, bot control (Shield Advanced), ALB/CloudFront scope.	aws sap security
Incident response?	Automate isolation (SG quarantine), snapshot forensic images, capture CloudTrail/X-Ray/Flow Logs; use playbooks.	aws sap security
Boundary isolation?	Use separate accounts/VPCs; SCP denies; endpoint policies; minimize blast radius with least privilege and tagging.	aws sap security
